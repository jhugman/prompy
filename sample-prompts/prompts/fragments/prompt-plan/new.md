description: Make a new prompt plan from the spec.

{{@spec/to-prompt-plan}}

Remember the implementation order should prioritize user-value: get something that the user can see working, and then build upon it.

Put all these prompts into a new file **docs/prompt-plan.md**. If this file exists already delete it and start again.
