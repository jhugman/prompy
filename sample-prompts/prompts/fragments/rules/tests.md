description: Rules about tests
---
- Tests MUST be executed frequently during development to ensure code quality and catch regressions early.
- When modifying code, tests MUST be run before committing changes to validate that existing functionality remains intact.
- Test execution MUST proceed automatically without requiring user confirmation, as confirmation prompts create friction that discourages frequent testing.
